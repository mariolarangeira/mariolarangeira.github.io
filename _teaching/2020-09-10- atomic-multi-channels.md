Atomic Multi-channels Updates and its Relation with Sprites


We got back our regular schedule of seminars. We opened the new season with a talk by Max, which reviewed the work "[Atomic Multi-Channel Updates with Constant Collateral in Bitcoin-Compatible Payment-Channel Networks](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3319535.3345666)" from CCS'19. 

The idea is to provide the updates between the channels that compose a payment-channel network (PCN), which is a concatenation of channels, in a atomic fashion. The [Sprites Protocol](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-32101-7_30) from FC'19 does something similar, however it relies on the use of smart-contracts. 

Here the idea is to do it without the aid of smart-contracts, therefore the "Bitcoin-Compatible" in the title.
