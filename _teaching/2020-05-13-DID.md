Seminar on Decentralized Identifiers (DID)

Today Su has presented his initial studies on DID and Verifiable Credentials. The main topic is to briefly overview the [DID](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) working group Draft, and discussed applications and privacy concerns on the [Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/).


This draft presents the general idea and the data structure of DID. Concretely, the standard aims to users and organizations to create their own identity. The identity is published in the ledger following the format in DID standard, containing endpoints to be used for interacting with other DID.


A typical example is the interaction between students and university. The university has its DID published on a decentralized ledger, and is publicly recognizable as the identification of the university. The student also creates his/her DID, and publishes it on the ledger. The DID contains an endpoint specifically designed to interact with universities, meaning  it has the known expected set of strings. Needless to say, these strings represent the information of the student. The student then, presentes this ID to the university in their private channel, to which the university responds with a credential. 

At this point, the verifiable credentials approach is used. Since this credential can be presented to any institution which can check the validity of them with the DID information of the university.
