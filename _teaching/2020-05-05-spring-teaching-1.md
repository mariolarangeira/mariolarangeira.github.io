MCS.T415-Topics on Mathematical and Computing Science B (数理・計算科学特論B).

Today we started our yearly  course on Cryptography and Blockchain Technologies at Tokyo Tech within our IOHK/Tokyo Tech Blockchain Lab. 

We have a **whopping 40 students** registered at the moment!

We were delayed in a month this year, and have a few restrictions because of the Corona virus. 
In particular we are still adjusting ourselves (instructors and students) to the new environment. Today was an entirely online class!

I guess the main problem in this platform is the lack of interaction between me and the students during the class. This interaction always help me. A simple "weird face", a gaze to the window, something more subtle always help me to know if I need to rephrase what I am saying, go slower on the contents,  repeat the slide or even stop and wait for the inevitable question.

Overview
======
Cryptocurrency, as the newest term is used, is a old dream for engineers and researchers, in particular, cryptographers. In the old days several other terms were also coined, as for example, electronic cash and digital money, however is that the most successful term, and piece of engineering, is what we see nowadays in the news: Cryptocurrency.

This course is divided in two very distinct but connected parts. The first will be focused on cryptocurrency, i.e., its history, the main components, practical aspects and theory. The second is more focused on cryptographic protocols.

| Cryptocurrency                |           Cryptography                                |
| --------               	        | ------------------------------------------------------------  |
| History, general components, building blocks, applications, how to use, attacks    | commitments, zero knowledge, hash functions, commitments, signature, formal proofs.                      |

Objective
======

The main goal of this course is give the opportunity for the students to learn about cryptocurrencies and cryptographic protocols.
- More concretely the course will present:
	- History of cryptocurrency;
	- Practical description;
	- Review the main components;
		* Cryptocurrency: wallets, mining, blockchain, ledgers, consensus;
		* Cryptography: security models, provable security, commitments, signatures, and zero knowledge.

- Review the theory and design of cryptocurrencies;
	* What the course does not aim: Give financial counseling;
- Approach in details ICO’s and other business related topics.
