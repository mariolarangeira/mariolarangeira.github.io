Anonymity in Identity Based Encryption Schemes

Mizuuchi gave us a presentation on Identity based schemes and their security definitions. The main idea is to explore possibilities of application of such systems with the aid of a data structure as the blockchain. Mizuuchi is interested in anonymity and privacy in blockchain/cryptocurrency systems. We noticed that privacy preserving cryptocurrencies, like Monero or ZCash, are based heavily on ring signatures and ZK proofs. However we did not find similar systems with IBE schemes.

The seminar was based divided in three parts: (1) definition of IBE schemes, (2) security notions (3) discussions regarding anonymity and security notions.
