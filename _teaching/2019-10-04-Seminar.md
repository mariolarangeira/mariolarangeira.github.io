Work on submissions, and review of security proof

Although all are busy writing, one or two had time to present in the seminar. Max, for example, presented an overview of his formalization for his lightweight payment protocol. In particular the UC model.

Today is also the first day for Mizuuchi. He joined our cryptocurrency group and he is still looking for a problem to study in his master course.
