Overview
======
Cryptocurrency, as the newest term is used, is a old dream for engineers and researchers, in particular, cryptographers. In the old days several other terms were also coined, as for example, electronic cash and digital money, however is that the most successful term, and piece of engineering, is what we see nowadays in the news: Cryptocurrency.

This course is divided in two very distinct but connected parts. The first will be focused on cryptocurrency, i.e., its history, the main components, practical aspects and theory. The second is more focused on cryptographic protocols.


| Cryptocurrency                |           Cryptography                                |
| --------               	        | ------------------------------------------------------------  |
| History, general components, building blocks, applications, how to use, attacks    | commitments, zero knowledge, hash functions,  secret sharing, digital signature and formal proofs.                    |

Objective
======
The main goal of this course is give the opportunity for the students to learn about cryptocurrencies and cryptographic protocols.
- More concretely the course will present:
	- History of cryptocurrency;
	- Practical description;
	- Review the main components;
		* Cryptocurrency: wallets, mining, blockchain, ledgers, consensus;
		* Cryptography: security models, provable security, commitments, signatures, and zero knowledge.

- Review the theory and design of cryptocurrencies;
	* What the course does not aim: Give financial counseling;
- Approach in details ICO’s and other business related topics.
