We turned our attention on the Extended UTXO Model (via teleconference).

During the Financial Cryptography and Data Security Conference 2020, it was also organized the 4th Workshop on Trusted Smart Contracts which the new Extended UTXO Model was proposed by [Chakravarty et al.](http://fc20.ifca.ai/wtsc/WTSC2020/WTSC20_paper_25.pdf).

 Max presented their work and discussed the changes of the model introduced  by them and their consequence for future works. Max has been studying state channels, therefore he could relate these new developments to the already existing state channel protocols.

We ended the seminar discussing possible developments.

What is new this time is that for the first time we have started seminar on our homes, given the restrictions imposed by the Corona virus on the daily lives of us all. For the first time, I think we did very well. 

Congratulations, Max!
