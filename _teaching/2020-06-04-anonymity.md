Anonymity in Anonymous Credentials and Ring Signatures.

Mizuuchi has been interested in concepts of anonymity and privacy. These two terms are widely used
in the literature of blockchain systems. He has been studying these definitions on privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies. Today, he focused this presentation in two works, [Accountable Anonymous Credential](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-13-1483-4_3)   and [Ring Signature](https://eprint.iacr.org/2005/304.pdf).

Next week, Mizuuchi will continue his seminar.
