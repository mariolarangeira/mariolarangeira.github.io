Today we had a seminar about anonymous multi-hop locks. 

This construction is crucial for construction of payment channels resistant to the wormhole attack, which is caused by the shared pre-image value of the Hash Time Locked Contract (HTLC) among the intermediate nodes of the channel. Briefly in this novel construction the values are generated for each pairwise channel. Therefore, each pair of nodes lock funds independently of the other channels in the network.

Kurazumi have presented the lock mechanism of the work by [Malavolta et al.](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/472.pdf) and how it is constructed from the distributed ECDSA signature protocol.
