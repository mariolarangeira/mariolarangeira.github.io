Intensive work on lightweight payment channel protocol.

Max is working on the formalization on a lightweight virtual payment protocol, which does not rely on smart-contracts. He reviewed his whole formalization in the next four seminars:

* today: review of ledger and script functionalities
* 10/31: discussion on interface of the functionality for pairwise protocol
* 11/7:  presentation of the pairwise functionality
* 11/12: simulator construction (sketch)

In the end we discussed the UC formalization and the simulation in the ideal world execution.
