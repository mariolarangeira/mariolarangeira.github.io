Hail Hydra!

As a follow up of last week seminar on Extended UTXO Model proposed by [Chakravarty et al.](http://fc20.ifca.ai/wtsc/WTSC2020/WTSC20_paper_25.pdf), today we took a look on the  [Hydra protocol](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/299).


This is very convenient because Hidra is based on the Extended UTXO. We did a quick review on the state machine implemented by the protocol and the interplay between the extended UTXO and the state changes.
