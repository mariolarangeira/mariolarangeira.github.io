Seminar on Anonymous Decentralized Credentials.

Today Su has presented his ongoing studies on Anonymous Decentralized Credentials. This is a follow up seminar from the one about Decentralized IDs (DID) more on this [here](/teaching/2020-05-13-DID). 

The main contents of his seminar was about [this paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/622.pdf). We basically went through the main process of create, or mint, a new credential and verify it, as well the process of showing it. These are two different procedures in their work.

In a second step we look on how these procedures are implemented in their draft, in particular how they use accumulators in order to implement privacy.
