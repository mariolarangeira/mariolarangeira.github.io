This week we had a special guest for our weekly seminar in our cryptocurrency group. 

[Dominik Harz](https://scholar.google.dk/citations?user=s6Km5yQAAAAJ&hl=en) visited us to present his work on how to design collateral in blockchain systems. In particular, the explained his framework [Balance: Dynamic Adjustment of Cryptocurrency Deposits](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3319535.3354221) presented at CCS'19. 

He also presented a didactical explanation of the very recent  Flash Loan attacks, which had been flooding comments on Twitter last week. An insightful description written by Dominik is already available [here](https://medium.com/@dominik.harz/stealing-all-of-makers-collateral-f940970605b1)!
