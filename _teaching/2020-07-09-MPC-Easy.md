MPC is hard!

The seminar this week was a bit different. Instead of Blockchain and Cryptography in a very theoretical manner. Mathias brought was a different topic which is ways of making the implementation of MPC easier. 

His research is about developing frameworks to help developers to implement MPC without much struggle and in a correct form.
