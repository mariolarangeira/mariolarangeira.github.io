Mizuuchi's focused on privacy preserving consensus protocols

Mizuuchi brought an overview on protocols for privacy that deals with the consensus layer. In particular, we discussed 
* Ouroboros Crypsinous (S&P'19)
* Ganesh et al. (Euro'19) 
* Quisquis
 
 The former two are related to privacy on the consensus layer, whereas the latter presents a framework for transactions.
