Eltoo Payment Channel

This week Max gave his seminar about payment channels. Max has been working on payment channels, and off-chain protocol in general. In particular, he worked hard in a lightweight version of virtual channels. His version of the virtual payment channels can be implemented in a blockchain systems that do not have heavy smart-contract capabilities. In particular, Bitcoin is a target for his protocol.  It is the first protocol of its kind.

In this seminar, Max continue survey different protocols for payment channels, and presented to us the Eltoo protocol. This protocol is an alternative to Lightning and Duplex channels.
