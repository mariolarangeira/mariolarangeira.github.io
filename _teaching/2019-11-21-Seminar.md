Discussion about SCIS 2020 and new member

Last year we had five presentations for SCIS 2019, however this year we are still working on ideas that are not ready for the workshop, namely [SCIS 2020](https://www.iwsec.org/scis/2020/), with the exception of Kurazumi's work on privacy-preserving multi-hop payment channels. 

Moreover, we have a new member in our group Bei Fen who joined the lab for his PhD.
