I have been working with my co-authors from XX Networks, David Chaum, Mario Yaksetig and William Carter, to develop a special trick for wallets. The idea is that in a major, and catastrophic, event when several wallets are hacked, there is still a possibility of the rightful user issue a proof ownership of the wallet. That is, in a nutshell, what this work is about.

Events like that had already occurred therefore it seems highly desirable that wallets have such capability.  

We are now working on the final version of the work and it will soon be made public!
