Me and Dimitris Karakostas are excited to announce that  a [new book](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-32146-7) on blockchain systems named "Blockchains: A Handbook on Fundamentals, Platforms and Applications." 

Our contribution in the book is a chapter on the current knowledge on proof of stake (PoS) based blockchains. We detailed some of the known attacks and also how we could add delegation for delegated PoS.
