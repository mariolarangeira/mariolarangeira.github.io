We had two works accepted for ICISC 2022.  

One is our second follow up [work](/publication/2022-12-02-ICISC-WOTSwana) on [Sleeve](/portfolio/2021-06-21-ACNS/) (the first first follow up work is [here](/publication/2022-07-12-MARBLE-Sleeve)). The other is my first single author [paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1165). I need to emphasize that I am really proud of the title of this work! 

And I also should say that, despite of the pun, it is technically true. The work introduces a concrete reputation mechanism on a stake based ledger, hence the title. The idea is to repurpose the delegation framework we [developed](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/525), and it is already deployed at [Cardano](https://cardano.org/), in order to allow users to 'assign trust'. 

The idea is to create a special delegation method (without disturbing the consensus protocol) which would mean a relationship of trust among the users. Since it is based on stake, it can be publicly verifiable in the ledger. 

Our work will be presented (yes, I am writing it in advance) at ICISC 2022 in the next few days.
