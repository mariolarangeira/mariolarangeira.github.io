Su has managed to get his work, which he has done during his master course,  accepted at IEEE International Conference on Blockchain and Cryptocurrency. He has already presented it in our [internal seminar](teaching/2020-06-18-time-lock-puzzle), and now we are still working on the version to be published, it will be a short paper.
