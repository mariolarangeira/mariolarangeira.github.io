With some delay, I'm sharing the publication of our Lightweight Virtual Channels. We denote it ''lightweight'', because differently from previous constructions of virtual channels, our protocol does not need smart contracts to be implemented. Hence, it can be freely used in Bitcoin. 

Our presentation was on the [second day](https://cans2020.at/program-day-2/). One advantage of the new normal where the conferences are online is that the recorded presentations are widely available. Here is [ours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwVmyxi_jmM).

Max conducted the online live presentation, and answered the questions from the audience.
