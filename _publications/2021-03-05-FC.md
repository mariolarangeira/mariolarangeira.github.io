Recently Max have presented his work, the Payment Trees protocol, at FC'21!
He has been studying similar protocols, in fact, we have discussed these ideas in our [internal seminars](/teaching/2020-09-10-atomic-multi-channels). This work is based on techniques we have already presented in [previous conferences](/publication/2020-12-15-virtualchannelsCANS).

Our presentation was on the [third day](https://fc21.ifca.ai/program.php),  and here is the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_s01QsnLiY) of our presentation in the conference channel.
