We are happy to announce that our work on more secure wallets was accepted and will be presented at [SECRYPT'25](https://www.insticc.org/node/technicalprogram/SECRYPT/2025) this week. 

The novel idea is the Cardano address system has extra properties which allow sophisticated security features. So far, such features have not been fully explored. This piece of research pushes the state of the art of security leveraging in these native properties.  In particular, we take advantage of the two key (for payment and staking) available on the Cardano address system. This design was also proposed by is in 2020 in a paper published at SCN'20.

This research potentially opens a venue to new products. More concretely, safer types of wallets with advanced security features like the proposed hot and cold wallet design. This is particularly interesting for users that have large funds, like stake pool operators, which could rely on the naturally more secure cold wallet, for example.

Curious?  

Soon it will be available to Eprint and IOG Website!
