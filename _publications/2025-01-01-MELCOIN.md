We are happy to announce that work which introduces a novel consensus  construction was accepted and will be presented at [ACNS'25](https://acns2025.fordaysec.de/accepted-papers/). 

The novel idea is to mix the combinatorics problem of finding the best matching in an auction system, i.e., matching buying and selling bids, in a way that participants who are trying to find the optimal solution, i.e., the best possible combination of bids, can be harvested in order to build a blockchain system. 

That is, given the bids, the participant who finds the best combination of bids put them into a block, and advertise it as the best block to others participants (who are also trying to find the best combination). If it really is the best block, under some score definition, then its proposer is the new leader.  There you have it! A consensus protocol.

Curious?  

Here is [our work](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1471)!

Have fun!
