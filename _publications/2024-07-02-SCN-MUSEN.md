We are happy to announce that [our work](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/628) which introduces a novel VRF construction, named MUSEN, with forward security  was accepted and will be presented at [SCN'24](https://scn.unisa.it/scn24/index.php/accepted-papers/). 


Here we introduced a new VRF with forward security capabilities. That is a significant improvement since VRF are used in proof of stake based blockchain protocols which could be target of ``nothing at stake'' attacks, where old keys can be used to attack the protocol.
