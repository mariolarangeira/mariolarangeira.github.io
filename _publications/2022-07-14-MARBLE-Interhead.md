We had two works on MARBLE 2022.  

One is our follow up [work](/publication/2022-07-12-MARBLE-Sleeve) on [Sleeve](/portfolio/2021-06-21-ACNS/). The other is Max's approach to the [Hydra](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/299). Namely the [Interhead Protocol](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1188).

Here, instead of having only a single head, i.e., group of users interacting off-chain via the Hydra protocol, alone, our protocol allows two heads to merge into a single head, hence the title. It is a very interesting work since it gives more agility to the groups of users.

Our work was presented at MARBLE 2022
