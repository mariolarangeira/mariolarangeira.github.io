This week we attended the 12th Conference on Security and Cryptography for Networks (SCN). Unfortunately it was not this time I visited the beautiful Amalfi Coast. The event was held online and it was a very friendly atmosphere.  The Program Chair Vladimir Kolesnikov gave initial considerations about the event, of a very high level conference. One of the statistics presented by Vladimir is that only 3 out of 8 papers was accepted for publication.
