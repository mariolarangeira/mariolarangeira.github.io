We are excited to announce that Su and Pengfei have their  [work](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1060) accepted for [ACNS'24](https://wp.nyu.edu/acns2024/accepted-papers-r2/).

Su and Pengfei introduced a new protocol in order to trace contact between people. The main idea is that an application on, for example on the phone, would keep a list of other phones that approximated a particular holder of the phone. Then the owner of the phone assigns, if he or she experience symptoms of an infectious disease (like, Covid, for example) it releases a ciphered list of contacts which the other phones could check, and know if it was exposed or not, releasing themselves their respective lists. 


The main goal is that people with that knowledge could isolated themselves faster, helping to combat the spread of the virus. 


The core contribution in this protocol ia a new auditable signature scheme.
