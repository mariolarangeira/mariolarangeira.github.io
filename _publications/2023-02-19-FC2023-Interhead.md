We will be presenting at FC'23!

Max came up with a better construction for the [Interhead Protocol (which was presented at MARBLE 2022)](/publication/2022-07-14-MARBLE-Interhead). Briefly, this protocol implements a technique to merge "heads" of the [Hydra Protocol](https://www.springerprofessional.de/en/fast-isomorphic-state-channels/19786778). This paves a way to build better decentralized applications. The capability of merge layer-2 groups of participants provides more flexibility.

We remark that used interactively, a second head, with only two participants, one which is also participant of an earlier bigger head, could sponsor the merge of both heads. The result is a protocol of enlarging off-chain isomorphic group.

Soon the manuscript will be available in the FC and EPrint website!
