We are excited to announce that Su has its [work](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1059) accepted for [NSS'23](https://nss-socialsec2023.cyber.kent.ac.uk/).

Su introduces  the distributed  proof-of-deep-learning (D-PoDL) which repurposes the computational power of networks to train computational models. In that sense, Su's work fits in the approach of finding better uses of huge computational power available in blockchain systems in particular those based in proof-of-work ones.
