IOG came up with a nice layer 2 protocol named Hydra. It proposes the creation of multiparty channels, named heads. They  are basically a group of users that are expected to trade very frequently, so they go off chain in order to speed up  the issuing of transactions much beyond what the ledger allows. 

Until 2023 heads were isolated animals. Then we introduced a way that they could be merged in a bigger head. Moreover,  perhaps in a surprising way, we showed that such merging  could be done without interacting with the ledger. That is our [Interhead Protocol](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1027.pdf) which is also available in the [IOG Library](https://iohk.io/jp/research/library/papers/state-machines-across-isomorphic-layer-2-ledgers/). 

Alice and Bob presented a [deep dive](https://youtu.be/jHeOvpaC5HY) into the work and outlined the major features of our protocol.
