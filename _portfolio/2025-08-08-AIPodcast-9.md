Here is our  protocol named  [Payment Trees](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1313.pdf) which is also available in the [IOG Library](https://iohk.io/jp/research/library/papers/payment-trees-low-collateral-payments-for-payment-channel-networks/). 

Payment Trees is a way to close channels in a more efficient way, without the the need of smart contract. In comparison, the Sprites protocol rely on smart contracts. Instead, our protocol makes use of the UTxO Model properties.

Again, Alice and Bob's discussion is very didactical and it is available [here](https://youtu.be/xz6xarT3spY).

Have fun!
