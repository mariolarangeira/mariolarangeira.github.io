This time we will cover one of our newest paper, named "Adaptively Secure Blockchain-Aided Decentralized Storage Networks: Formalization and Generic Construction". It is still unpublished, but available in the [Eprint Archive](https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/887) and it is to topic of conversation between our characters in their podcast: Alice & Bob Podcast Episode #3.

However there is a catch!

This time we have two videos about the paper. A [short version](https://youtu.be/adgpOgGII0c) (5 minutes), which is enough to glimpse the idea of the draft. But for those with more time and interest we also have a  [long version](https://youtu.be/42-m9OBCN0w) (about 60 minutes).

Enjoy!
