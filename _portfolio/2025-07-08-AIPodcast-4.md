Alice and Bob now discuss the "Reputation on Stake!" 

This is a paper we had presented a couple of years ago in [ICISC 2022](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/978-3-031-29371-9_10). It deals with a repurposing, for reputation, the delegation framework already in production in Cardano Blockchain, a delegated proof of stake system, hence the title of the paper! The draft is also available in the [Eprint Archive](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1165.pdf).


Alice and Bob gave a quick review of the paper showcasing its main points. Enjoy the [Alice & Bob Podcast Episode #4](https://youtu.be/K03ddjFLX1s).

We missed last week podcast, so wait for an extra one later this week.


Stay tuned!
