This year we presented a work on at the 19th International Conference on Cryptology and Network Security. Maxim Jourenko prepared a pre-recorded video for the conference in addition to a 5-minute live presentation and Q&A session.

The pre-recorded video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwVmyxi_jmM) 

Enjoy!
