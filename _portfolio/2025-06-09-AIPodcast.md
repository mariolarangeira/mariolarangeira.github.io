In conjunction of our presentation at SECRYPT'25 about our new paper  "Secure and Practical cold (and Hot Staking)" paper, we are starting our series named Alice & Bob Podcast #1. 

They give a nice overview on the paper and it is perfect for the audience that are not much interested in reading the whole paper, but is still interested in knowing what is going on in the work. 

It is an audio-only podcast, so it is perfect to listen to it while doing something else.  The first episode is [here](https://youtu.be/VeXhapZbQgk). 

Enjoy and expect future episodes!
