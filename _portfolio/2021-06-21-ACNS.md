We just had a presentation on the 19th International Conference on Applied Cryptography and Network Security. The original plan was to hold the event in the beautiful Kamakura, unfortunately the conference had to be virtual. 

This paper was really nice to work with my co-authors, David Chaum, Mario Yaksetig and William Carter.  We started with a simple, and fairly naive idea, and we developed a new scheme which we call Sleeve (an analogy to have a trick/card hidden in the sleeve for critical situations). 

The work promotes a straightforward approach which is to embed a key within a key to be used for a back up.  We believe we can improve on this idea in several ways. 

So, stay tuned!
