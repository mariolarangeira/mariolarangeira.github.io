Here is our new protocol named  [AucRandMUSEN](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1643.pdf) which is also available in the [IOG Library](https://iohk.io/jp/research/library/papers/optimizing-liveness-for-blockchain-based-sealed-bid-auctions-in-rational-settings/), which was presented by Huang in the [CoDecFin Workshop](https://fc25.ifca.ai/codecfin/). 



Bob and Alice went to describe the main idea of the protocol and discussed while performing a deep dive into the work. Their discussion is available [here](https://youtu.be/e7vwAy0x620)

Enjoy!
