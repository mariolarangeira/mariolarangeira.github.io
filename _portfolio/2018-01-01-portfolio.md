In 2018, IOHK gathered to exchange ideas and share the work done. I have presented our research projects regarding card game protocols.  The presentation highlights major differences and similarities of our three protocols: Royale, Kaleidoscope and 21.

The full presentation is available on youtube in the IOHK Main [channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5YN3oN93fE).
