This year we presented a work on at the 12th Conference on Security and Cryptography for Networks. We prepared a pre-recorded video for the conference in addition to a 5-minute live presentation and Q&A session.

The pre-recorded video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKux9Rl7gNU&feature=youtu.be) 

Enjoy!
