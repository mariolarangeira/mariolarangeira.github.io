Here is our new Verifiable Random Function (VRF) [MUSEN](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/628.pdf) which is also available in the [IOG Library](https://iohk.io/jp/research/library/papers/musen-aggregatable-key-evolving-verifiable-random-functions-and-applications/). 

We proposed a novel cryptographic primitive with some very interesting properties, and we also outline where it can be used. Alice and Bob presented a fairly didactical [discussion about MUSEN](https://youtu.be/25xK1iHP_uQ). 

This is a somewhat different work from previous ones in the podcast, because it focuses in a building block.
