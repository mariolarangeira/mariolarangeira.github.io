The University of Pelotas in the southern of Brazil has a series of seminars with researchers from outside of the university. The idea is that the students of the faculty could interact and get to know other areas. 

The idea is that the guest would  start by describing big areas of interest, and then let the students way in and ask questions. This year, I was invited by my colleague and old friend Prof. Ricard Araujo (we used to be classmates when we both attended the course in electronics at ETFPel) to describe what I have been doing and what I am interested. 

I started by presenting, very broadly, what a blockchain system is, and then we ended up by just having a pleasing chat.

The chat is available on the [channel of the university](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPmDFDy_tj4) 

Enjoy!
