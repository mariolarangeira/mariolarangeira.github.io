This year we presented a work on at the 25th Financial Cryptography and Data Security. Maxim Jourenko prepared a pre-recorded video for the conference in addition to a 5-minute live presentation and Q&A session.

The pre-recorded video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_s01QsnLiY) 

I hope you like it!
