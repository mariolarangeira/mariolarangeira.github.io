Happy New Year!

This is Mount Fuji in the last day of 2019.

I have been thinking about revisiting my old blog for quite a while now. More than that. The idea was to turn it into a central point to gather information about my activities. A few students and colleagues had told me, to my surprise, that was hard to find information about myself online. 

These comments lingered in my mind and added up with my personal concerns that I needed to give more visibility to my research and professional interests. The problem was to set some time apart to brush out my skills of "web design". 

Two weeks of vacation solved that and now I have a website: [Mario Report](/)
