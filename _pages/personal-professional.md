I have been living in Tokyo since 2006, when I joined Tokyo Tech as a research student just after graduated at [ITA](https://www.ita.br) in Brazil as Computer Engineer in 2004. After a brief period working at [Embraer](https://embraer.com), I received the widely popular Monbukagakusho Scholarship and moved to Japan. At [Tokyo Tech](https://www.titech.ac.jp), I have worked during my master and PhD under the supervision of Prof. Keisuke Tanaka on cryptographic models for provable security. Notably, I have focused on the Random Oracle, Generic Group and Ring Models and the [thesis is publicly available](https://www.iacr.org/phds/?p=detail&entry=1232). I am currently managing the Blockchain Lab founded by [IOHK](https://iohk.io) at Tokyo Tech jointly with Prof. Keisuke Tanaka.

Story of Dois Gugol/Two Googol
=====

[BASED ON A TRUE STORY OF A FRIEND]


One day in the classroom the chemistry teacher was explaining that nothing in the universe is greater than one [googol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googol). He was very emphatic about this topic, and continued:

<img style="float:right" src="/images/burajiru.jpeg" width="400">
"Number of atoms in the universe? 10^78! Less than one googol!"

"Number of protons in the universe? 10^80! Less than one googol!"

"Number of  photons in the universe? 10^84! Less than one googol!"

"Nothing is greater than one googol!"

At this time, he focused on a notoriously funny student in the back of the classroom, and fired his damming question.

"You! What is greater than one googol!?"

The student thought and answered:

"Two googol!"
