*Mario Report* is an updated version of an [old blog](http://doisgugol.blogspot.com) whose name has an [explanation](/markdown).  

In this new  version I gather content material of my professional activities at [Tokyo Tech](https://www.titech.ac.jp) and [IOHK](https://iohk.io). 

In the above tabs,  publications, talks, seminars, resume and videos, and, of course, the new version of the *Dois Gugol Blog* (in English: *Two Googol*).
