I"³<p>With some delay, Iâ€™m sharing the publication of our Lightweight Virtual Channels. We denote it â€˜â€˜lightweightâ€™â€™, because differently from previous constructions of virtual channels, our protocol does not need smart contracts to be implemented. Hence, it can be freely used in Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Our presentation was on the <a href="https://cans2020.at/program-day-2/">second day</a>. One advantage of the new normal where the conferences are online is that the recorded presentations are widely available. Here is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwVmyxi_jmM">ours</a>.</p>

<p>Max conducted the online live presentation, and answered the questions from the audience.</p>
