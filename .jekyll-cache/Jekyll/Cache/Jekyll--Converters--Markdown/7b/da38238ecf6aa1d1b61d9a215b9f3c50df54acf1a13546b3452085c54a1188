<p>During June 24 and 25, we organized in the Oookayama Campus the Cardano Days, for all faculty members and all sorts of interested people could visit us at the campus for a two-day workshop on the Cardano technology.</p>

<p>We were glad to receive the IO Education team from abroad which promoted very in depth discussions on the current trends from networking, wallet handling, and governance. We had a dive in on the used technology as well as the update on the state of the art in terms of research being investigated here in Tokyo.</p>
