I"¯<p>Brazilian Researchers in Japan and Brazilian Embassy</p>

<p>Today I had a meeting with the other Brazilian researchers and professors based in Japan. Including an old friend, like Prof. Claus who is a fellow student in Tokyo, and now is based in Tsukuba. The motivation of the meeting is to st ties between the research community in Japan and the embassy.</p>

<p>However we could not deviate from the topic of the COVID-19 and how it is affecting, researchers and students during their study period in Japanese universities. Later we discussed ways of increasing the number of researchers here, as well as ways of coordinate this community towards to show to the Brazilian community in Japan how we help Japan by improving science.</p>
