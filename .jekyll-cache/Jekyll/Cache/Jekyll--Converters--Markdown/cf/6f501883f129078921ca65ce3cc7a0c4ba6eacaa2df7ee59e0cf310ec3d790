I"<p>We are excited to announce that we have a new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15269">accepted paper</a> 
 for <a href="https://nss-socialsec2023.cyber.kent.ac.uk/">NSSâ€™23</a>.</p>

<p>Su introduces  the distributed  proof-of-deep-learning (D-PoDL) which repurposes the computational power of networks to train computational models. In that sense, Suâ€™s work fits in the approach of finding better uses of huge computational power available in blockchain systems in particular those based in proof-of-work ones.</p>
