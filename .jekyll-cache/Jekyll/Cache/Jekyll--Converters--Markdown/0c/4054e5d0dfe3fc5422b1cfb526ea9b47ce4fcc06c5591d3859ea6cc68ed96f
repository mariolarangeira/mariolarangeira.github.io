<p>Here is our new protocol named  <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1643.pdf">AucRandMUSEN</a> which is also available in the <a href="https://iohk.io/jp/research/library/papers/optimizing-liveness-for-blockchain-based-sealed-bid-auctions-in-rational-settings/">IOG Library</a>, which was presented by Huang in the <a href="https://fc25.ifca.ai/codecfin/">CoDecFin Workshop</a>.</p>
