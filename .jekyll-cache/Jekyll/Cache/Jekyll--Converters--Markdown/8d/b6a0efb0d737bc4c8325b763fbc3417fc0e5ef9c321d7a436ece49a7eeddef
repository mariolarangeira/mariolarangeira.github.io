I"²<p>We are excited to announce that Su and Pengfei have their  <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1060">work</a> accepted for <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/acns2024/accepted-papers-r2/">ACNSâ€™24</a>.</p>

<p>Su and Pengfei introduced a new protocol in order to trace contact between people. The main idea is that an application on, for example on the phone, would keep a list of other phones that approximated a particular holder of the phone. Then the owner of the phone assigns, if he or she experience symptoms of an infectious disease (like, Covid, for example) it releases a ciphered list of contacts which the other phones could check, and know if it was exposed or not, releasing themselves their respective lists.</p>

<p>The main goal is that people with that knowledge could isolated themselves faster, helping to combat the spread of the virus.</p>

<p>The core contribution in this protocol ia a new auditable signature scheme.</p>
