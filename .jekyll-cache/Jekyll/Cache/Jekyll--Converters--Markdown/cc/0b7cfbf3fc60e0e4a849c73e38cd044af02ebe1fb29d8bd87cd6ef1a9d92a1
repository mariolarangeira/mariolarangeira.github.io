<p>A couple of years ago we presented a protocol named Maravedí in this paper named “Maravedí: A Secure and Practical Protocol to Trade Risk for Instantaneous Finality.”  It is available in the <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/183.pdf">Eprint Archive</a>  and [IOG Library Website](https://iohk.io/jp/research/library/papers/maravedi-a-secure-and-practical-protocol-to-trade-risk-for-instantaneous-finality/) and it is to topic of conversation between our characters in their podcast: Alice &amp; Bob Podcast in Episode #5.</p>

<p>Their conversation is already available <a href="https://youtu.be/W38drdt2xbY">here</a>! It is a bit long, because they gone over the real details between the protocol players. I guess the most important take away from their conversation is how they describe the main ideas about risk, how the instantaneous finality is achieved, how security is thought, etc. The real details sound complicated to follow but I think it is still a nice podcast to listen to.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
