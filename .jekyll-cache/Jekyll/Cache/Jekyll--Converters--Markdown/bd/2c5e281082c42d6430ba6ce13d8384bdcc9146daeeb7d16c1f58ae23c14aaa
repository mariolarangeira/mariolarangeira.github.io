<p>The University of Pelotas in the southern of Brazil has a series of seminars with researchers from outside of the university. The idea is that the students of the faculty could interact and get to know other areas.</p>

<p>The idea is that the guest would  start by describing big areas of interest, and then let the students way in and ask questions. This year, I was invited by my colleague and old friend Prof. Ricard Araujo (we used to be classmates when we both attended the course in electronics at ETFPel) to describe what I have been doing and what I am interested.</p>

<p>I started by presenting, very broadly, what a blockchain system is, and then we ended up by just having a pleasing chat.</p>

<p>The chat is available on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPmDFDy_tj4">channel of the university</a></p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
