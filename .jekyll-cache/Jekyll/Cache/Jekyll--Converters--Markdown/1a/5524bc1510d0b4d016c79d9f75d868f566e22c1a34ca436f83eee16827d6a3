I"§<p>When I moved to Sao JosÃ© dos Campos to prepare to attend university (ITA) in Brazil, I heard from teachers that in some university somewhere they took seeds from Newtonâ€™s famous apple tree and planted a new tree in the campus.</p>

<p>We were not quite sure whether that story was true or not. Nor we got the name of the university. Nonetheless me and classmates would wonder how cool/inspiring it would be to look through the window in your classroom and see that tree overthere.</p>

<p>Fast forward, 25 years later I met the tree!</p>

<p>Thanks, Cambridge! 
See you in the next adventure!</p>
