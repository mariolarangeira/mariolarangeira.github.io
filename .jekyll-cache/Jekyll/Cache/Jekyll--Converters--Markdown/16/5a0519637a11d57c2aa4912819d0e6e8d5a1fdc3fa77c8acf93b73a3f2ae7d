I"4<p>This week the International Conference on Network and System Security (NSS’23) happens and we have our work on distributed deep learning. It is a joint work of me, Xiangyu Su and Keisuke Tanaka. Su is the main author and has introduced the main idea.</p>

<p>Su noticed that it is possible to harvest of a  computational power from, say of a proof of work protocol, in order to train models for machine learning. In order to do that we had to introduce new notions like “proof-of-deep-Learning”.</p>

<p>Basically, instead of “correct hash value” as in proof-of-work, we look for models with suitable accuracy in the learning curve. The paper is already available <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-39828-5_7">here</a> and <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1059">here</a>.</p>
