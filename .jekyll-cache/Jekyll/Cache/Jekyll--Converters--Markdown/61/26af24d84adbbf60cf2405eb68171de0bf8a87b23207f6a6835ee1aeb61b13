I"Ê<p>MCS.T415-Topics on Mathematical and Computing Science B (æ•°ç†ãƒ»è¨ˆç®—ç§‘å­¦ç‰¹è«–B).</p>

<p>Today we started our yearly  course on Cryptography and Blockchain Technologies at Tokyo Tech within our IOHK/Tokyo Tech Blockchain Lab.</p>

<p>We have a <strong>whopping 40 students</strong> registered at the moment!</p>

<p>We were delayed in a month this year, and have a few restrictions because of the Corona virus. 
In particular we are still adjusting ourselves (instructors and students) to the new environment. Today was an entirely online class!</p>

<p>I guess the main problem in this platform is the lack of interaction between me and the students during the class. This interaction always help me. A simple â€œweird faceâ€, a gaze to the window, something more subtle always help me to know if I need to rephrase what I am saying, go slower on the contents,  repeat the slide or even stop and wait for the inevitable question.</p>
