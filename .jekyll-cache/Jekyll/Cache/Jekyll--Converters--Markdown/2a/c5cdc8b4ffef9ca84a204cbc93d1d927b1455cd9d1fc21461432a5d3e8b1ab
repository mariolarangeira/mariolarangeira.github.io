I"„<p>We had two works on MARBLE 2022.  One is our follow up [work] on [Sleeve][/portfolio/2021-06-21-ACNS/] 
Those who follow this link already know that  I have been working with my co-authors from XX Networks, David Chaum and Mario Yaksetig to develop a special trick for wallets. The idea is that in a major, and catastrophic, event when several wallets are hacked, there is still a possibility of the rightful user issues a proof ownership of the wallet. This is the inspiration for our work with [Sleeve][/portfolio/2021-06-21-ACNS/] presented at ACNSâ€™21.</p>

<p>This time we developed a more formal security proof for our new construction, i.e.,  â€˜Tweakable Sleeveâ€™, which connects better to the state-of-the-art for ECDSA. Moreover, we changed the original construction by using Tweakable Hash Function instead of L-Tree data structure.</p>

<p>Our work was presented at MARBLE 2022</p>
