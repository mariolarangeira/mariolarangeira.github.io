I have been living in Tokyo since 2006, when I joined Tokyo Tech as a research student just after graduated at <a href="https://www.ita.br">ITA</a> in Brazil as Computer Engineer in 2004. After a brief period working at <a href="https://embraer.com">Embraer</a>, I received the widely popular Monbukagakusho Scholarship and moved to Japan. At <a href="https://www.titech.ac.jp">Tokyo Tech</a>, I have worked during my master and PhD under the supervision of Prof. Keisuke Tanaka on cryptographic models for provable security. Notably, I have focused on the Random Oracle, Generic Group and Ring Models and the <a href="https://www.iacr.org/phds/?p=detail&amp;entry=1232">thesis is publicly available</a>. I am currently managing the Blockchain Lab founded by <a href="https://iohk.io">IOHK</a> at Tokyo Tech jointly with Prof. Keisuke Tanaka.</p>

<p>[BASED ON A TRUE STORY OF A FRIEND]</p>

<p>One day in the classroom the chemistry teacher was explaining that nothing in the universe is greater than one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googol">googol</a>. He was very emphatic about this topic, and continued:</p>

<p><img style="float:right" src="/images/burajiru.jpeg" width="400" />
“Number of atoms in the universe? 10^78! Less than one googol!”</p>

<p>“Number of protons in the universe? 10^80! Less than one googol!”</p>

<p>“Number of  photons in the universe? 10^84! Less than one googol!”</p>

<p>“Nothing is greater than one googol!”</p>

<p>At this time, he focused on a notoriously funny student in the back of the classroom, and fired his damming question.</p>

<p>“You! What is greater than one googol!?”</p>

<p>The student thought and answered:</p>

<p>“Two googol!”</p>
