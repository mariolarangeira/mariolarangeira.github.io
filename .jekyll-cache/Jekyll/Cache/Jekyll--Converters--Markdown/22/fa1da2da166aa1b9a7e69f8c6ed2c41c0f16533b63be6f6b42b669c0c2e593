I"ò<p>A night flight from Tokyo, and a week of talks, sea and sun light!</p>

<p>This year the Financial Crypto and Data Secure Conference did a little detour from its usual venue and came to Asia, and for the first time to Malaysia. From Japan it takes a night flight to Kuala Lumpur and then to Kota Kinabalu in Borneo. Only a night flight is ok to take.  A trip to the other side of the planet, that is, to the Caribbean, would be a different story to attend it.</p>

<p>Despite the COVID19 outbreak in the region and all the constraints it brings, several researchers made to Malaysia, although there were a few absences  which the FC chairs managed to mitigate by asking the authors to record the presentations, and even call the them via Skype for Q&amp;A after the talks.</p>

<h3 id="talks">Talks</h3>
<p>There were a couple of talks that drawn out attention because we are more closely looking into to, specially those related to payment channels, including a SoK paper similar to one we released <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/352">last year on Eprint</a>.</p>

<p>During the poster session I was surprised by one of the works because the author explained  he relied on a technique that ``programs the generic group modelâ€™â€™. The reason of my surprise is that I have a <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Programmability-in-the-Generic-Ring-and-Group-Larangeira-Tanaka/82eae5edc81aa7cef9a68f83304b314e42aa42c5">work</a> from 9 years ago that introduces programmability in the Generic Group Model. Needless to say I was glad to see it being used (not sure, if it was cited though).</p>

<p>Two other works that I plan to check are about privacy-preserving atomic swap by Deshpande and Herlihy, and uncooperatively closing of payment channels by Nagamine and Matsuura. The former was also presented at <a href="https://www.iwsec.org/scis/2020/">SCIS 2020</a>.</p>

<p>We also had a few works by my colleagues from IOHK:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dionysis Zindros - Non-Interactive Proofs of Proof-of-Work</li>
  <li>Kostis Karantias - Proof-of-Burn</li>
  <li>Alexander Nemish - Marlowe</li>
  <li>Alexnder Nemish (on behalf of authors)- The Extended UTxO Model</li>
</ul>
