I"L<p>We had two works accepted for ICISC 2022.</p>

<p>One is our second follow up <a href="/publication/2022-12-02-ICISC-WOTSwana">work</a> on <a href="/portfolio/2021-06-21-ACNS/">Sleeve</a> (the first first follow up work is <a href="/publication/2022-07-12-MARBLE-Sleeve">here</a>). The other is my first single author <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1165">paper</a>. I need to emphasize that I am really proud of the title of this work!</p>

<p>And I also should say that, despite of the pun, it is technically true. The work introduces a concrete reputation mechanism on a stake based ledger, hence the title. The idea is to repurpose the delegation framework we <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/525">developed</a>, and it is already deployed at <a href="https://cardano.org/">Cardano</a>, in order to allow users to ‘assign trust’.</p>

<p>The idea is to create a special delegation which means trust among the users. Since it is based on stake, it can be publicly verifiable in the ledger.</p>

<p>Our work will be presented (yes, I am writing it in advance) at ICISC 2022.</p>
