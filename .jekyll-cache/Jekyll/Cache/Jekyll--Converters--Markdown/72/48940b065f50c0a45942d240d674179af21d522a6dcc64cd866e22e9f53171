<p>Happy New Year!</p>

<p>I have been thinking about revisit my old blog for quite a while now. More than that. The plan was turn it into a central point gather information about my activities. A few students and colleagues had told me, to my surprise, that was hard to find information about myself online.</p>

<p>These comments lingered in my mind and added up with my personal concerns that I needed to give more visibility to my research and professional interests. The problem was to set some time apart to brush out my skills of ‚Äúweb design‚Äù. Two weeks of vacation solved that.</p>
