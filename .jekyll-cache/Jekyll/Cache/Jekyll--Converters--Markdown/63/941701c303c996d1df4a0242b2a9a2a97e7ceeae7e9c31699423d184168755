<p>Alice and Bob now discuss the “Reputation on Stake!”</p>

<p>This is a paper we had presented a couple of years ago in <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/978-3-031-29371-9_10">ICISC 2022</a>. It deals with a repurposing, for reputation, the delegation framework already in production in Cardano Blockchain, a delegated proof of stake system, hence the title of the paper! The draft is also available in the <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1165.pdf">Eprint Archive</a>.</p>

<p>Alice and Bob gave a quick review of the paper showcasing its main points. Enjoy the <a href="https://youtu.be/K03ddjFLX1s">Alice &amp; Bob Podcast Episode #4</a>.</p>
