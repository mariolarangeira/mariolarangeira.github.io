I"#<p>We are happy to announce that <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1135">our work</a> on the state channels was accepted for <a href="https://2024.cansconference.org/programme?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR022yqOPonS5hXfv8Pr9nDpndYLjweS9kzSDj2n6pJNjQhE6kYhpBJbeYQ_aem_J8YVI0Zx8gO-Yl0Ng4O-Eg">CANSâ€™24</a>.</p>

<p>In this work, we take a look on the design of state-channel with audit capabilities. That is, a group of participants can trade on layer 2, i.e., off-chain, and a auditor can get along and inquiry about the past transactions.</p>
