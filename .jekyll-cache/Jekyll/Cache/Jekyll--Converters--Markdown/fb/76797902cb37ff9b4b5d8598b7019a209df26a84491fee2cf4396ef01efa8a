I"”<p>We had two accepted works for ICISC 2022.</p>

<p>One is a my first <a href="/publication/2022-11-30-ICISC-Reputation">single-author paper</a> (YES!) . The other is Maxâ€™s approach to the <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/299">Hydra</a>. Namely the <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1188">Interhead Protocol</a>.</p>

<p>Here, instead of having only a single head, i.e., group of users interacting off-chain via the Hydra protocol, alone, our protocol allows two heads to merge into a single head, hence the title. It is a very interesting work since it gives more agility to the groups of users.</p>

<p>Our work was presented at MARBLE 2022</p>
