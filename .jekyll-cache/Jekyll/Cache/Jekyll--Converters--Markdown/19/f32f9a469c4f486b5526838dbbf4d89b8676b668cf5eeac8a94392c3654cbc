<p>Happy New Year!</p>

<p>This is Mount Fuji in the last day of 2019.</p>

<p>I have been thinking about revisiting my old blog for quite a while now. More than that. The idea was to turn it into a central point to gather information about my activities. A few students and colleagues had told me, to my surprise, that was hard to find information about myself online.</p>

<p>These comments lingered in my mind and added up with my personal concerns that I needed to give more visibility to my research and professional interests. The problem was to set some time apart to brush out my skills of â€œweb designâ€.</p>

<p>Two weeks of vacation solved that: Now I have a website!</p>
