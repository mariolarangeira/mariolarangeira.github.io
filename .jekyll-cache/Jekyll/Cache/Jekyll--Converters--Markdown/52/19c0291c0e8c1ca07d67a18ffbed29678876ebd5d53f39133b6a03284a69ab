I"›<p>Atomic Multi-channels Updates and its Relation with Sprites</p>

<p>We got back our regular schedule of seminars. We opened the new season with a talk by Max, which reviewed the work â€œ<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3319535.3345666">Atomic Multi-Channel Updates with Constant Collateral in Bitcoin-Compatible Payment-Channel Networks</a>â€ from CCSâ€™19.</p>

<p>The idea is to provide the updates between the channels that compose a payment-channel network (PCN), which is a concatenation of channels, in a atomic fashion. The <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-32101-7_30">Sprites Protocol</a> from FCâ€™19 does something similar, however it relies on the use of smart-contracts.</p>

<p>Here the idea is to do it without the aid of smart-contracts, therefore the â€œBitcoin-Compatibleâ€ in the title.</p>
