I"Ö<p>We had two works on ICISC 2022.</p>

<p>One is our follow up <a href="/publication/2022-12-02-ICISC-WOTSwana">work</a> on <a href="/portfolio/2021-06-21-ACNS/">Sleeve</a>. The other is my first single author <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1165">paper</a>. I have to say that I am really proud of the title of this work!</p>

<p>And I should say that, despite of the pun, it is technically true. The work introduces a concrete reputation mechanism on a stake based ledger. The idea is to repurpose the already existing, and deployed at [Cardano], delegation framework we <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/525">developed</a></p>

<p>Our work will be presented (yes, I am writing it in advance) at ICISC 2022.</p>
