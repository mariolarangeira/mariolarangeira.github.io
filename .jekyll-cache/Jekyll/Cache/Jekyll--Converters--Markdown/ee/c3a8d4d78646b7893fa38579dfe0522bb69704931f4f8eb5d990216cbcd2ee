<p>Mizuuchi has been interested in concepts of anonymity and privacy. These two terms are widely used
in the literature of blockchain systems. He has been studying these definitions on privacy-preserving cryptocurrencies. Today, he focused this presentation in two works, <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-13-1483-4_3">Accountable Anonymous Credential</a>   and <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2005/304.pdf">Ring Signature</a>.</p>
