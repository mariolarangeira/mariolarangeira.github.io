I"K<p>I have been working with my co-authors from XX Networks, David Chaum, Mario Yaksetig and William Carter, to develop a special trick for wallets. The idea is that in a major, and catastrophic, event when several wallets are hacked, there is still a possibility of the rightful user issue a proof ownership of the wallet. That is, in a nutshell, what this work is about.</p>

<p>Events like that had already occurred therefore it seems highly desirable that wallets have such capability.</p>

<p>We are now working on the final version of the work and it will soon be made public!</p>
