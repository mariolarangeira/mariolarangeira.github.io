<p>During June 24 and 25 we organized in the Oookayama Campus the Cardano Days, when faculty members and all sorts of interested could visit us at the campus for a two-day workshop on the Cardano technology. We were glad to receive the IO Education team from abroad.</p>

<p>We had a dive in on the used technology as well as the update on the state of the art in terms of research being investigated here in Tokyo.</p>
