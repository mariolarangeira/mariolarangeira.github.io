<p>The main contents of his seminar was about <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/622.pdf">this paper</a>. We basically went through the main process of create, or mint, a new credential and verify it, as well the process of showing it. These are two different procedures in their work.</p>

<p>In a second step we look on how these procedures are implemented in their draft, in particular how they use accumulators in order to implement privacy.</p>
