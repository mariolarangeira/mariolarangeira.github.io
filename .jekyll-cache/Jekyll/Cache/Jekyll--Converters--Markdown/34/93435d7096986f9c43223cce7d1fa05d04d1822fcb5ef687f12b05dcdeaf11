I"*<p>We are happy to announce that work which introduces a novel consensus  construction was accepted and will be presented at <a href="https://acns2025.fordaysec.de/accepted-papers/">ACNSâ€™25</a>.</p>

<p>The novel idea is to mix the combinatorics problem of finding the best matching in an auction system, buying and selling bids, in a way that participants who are trying to find the optimal solution can be harvested in order to build a blockchain system.</p>

<p>That is, given bids, the participant who finds the best combination of bids put them into a blockchain and advertise it as the best block to others. If it really is the best block, under some score definition, then its proposer is the new leader.</p>

<p>Curious?</p>

<p>Here is <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1471">our work</a>!</p>
