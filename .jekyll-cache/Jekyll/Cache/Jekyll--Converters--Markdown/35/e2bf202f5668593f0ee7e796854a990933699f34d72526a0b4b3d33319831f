I"Ò<p>Seminar on Blockchain research at UFPel</p>

<p>This week I gave a seminar to the University of Pelotas, in Portuguese it is more well known as UFPel. I was invited by Professor Ricardo Araujo, an old friend from the high school. We used to share the workbench to perform experiments with electronic circuits.  Prof. Ricardo is a professor of machine learning at UFPel and is coordinating a series of seminars which are part of the course for graduate students.</p>

<p>The main idea is to present the students other areas in computer science. My presentation was basically a 1-hour description of a blockchain system and the brief description of a few cryptographic primitives. In the end, I presented some of the work we have been doing in our IOHK/Tokyo Tech Lab in Oookayama Campus. I added a few comments in a couple of more areas, including some of my PhD research, i.e., Generic Group Model and Algebraic Model.</p>

<p>The video of the whole presentation and the chat in the end, including the questions is available on Youtube in the channel of the department. However I should let you know in advance that the whole conversation is in Portuguese.</p>
