I"—<p>This week the International Conference on Network and System Security (NSS‚Äô23) happens and we have our work on distributed deep learning. It is a joint work of me, Xiangyu Su and Keisuke Tanaka. Su is the main author and has introduced the main idea.</p>

<p>Su noticed that it is possible to harvest of a  computational power from, say of a proof of work protocol, in order to train models for machine learning. In order to do that we had to introduce new notions like ‚Äúproof-of-deep-Learning‚Äù.</p>

<p>Basically, instead of ‚Äúcorrect hash value‚Äù as in proof-of-work, we look for models with suitable accuracy in the learning curve.</p>
