<p>Max is working on the formalization on a lightweight virtual payment protocol, which does not rely on smart-contracts. He reviewed his whole formalization in the next three seminars:</p>

<ul>
  <li>today: review of ledger and script functionalities</li>
  <li>10/31: discussion on interface of the functionality for pairwise protocol</li>
  <li>11/7:  presentation of the pairwise functionality</li>
</ul>

<p>In the end we discussed the UC formalization and the simulation in the ideal world execution.</p>
