<p>During a week in July I attended <a href="https://africacrypt2023.tn/">Africacrypt 2023</a> in Tunisia. I have presented the <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/183">Maravedí Protocol</a> which is a joint work with Maxim Jourenko.</p>

<p>I was very excited for the event because it was my first time in Africa, and, needless to say, it was very hot. Luckily the hotel was great, with a beach next to it. Which I may say I enjoyed every morning before the conference, given the benefits of the jetlag (I was waking up 5AM).</p>

<p>Me and Eunice joined a talk show organized by Antonio from the Kyodai Remittance, with the head of the  Consulate General of Brazil in Tokyo Guilherme Patriota, Tiago BonTempo, Taís Ueta, Rodrigo Fernandes and Rafaela Yoshiy about studying and building a career in Japan.</p>

<p>The conversation started with Rodrigo from <a href="https://www.studyinjapan.go.jp/ja/">Study in Japan</a> providing a thorough overview of available scholarships and preparation tips to move to Japan for studying. As I former scholarship awarded student myself, I familiar with some of the options presented there, however there is more available.</p>

<p>Me and Eunice shared some experiences with respect to our career here in Japan. It perhaps maybe a bit biased since both of us have academic careers. However, we also commented a bit of positions on industry, as much as we could.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, for the English/Japanese speaking audience, the event was carried in Portuguese without subtitles. For those interested, the whole show is available <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?extid=CL-UNK-UNK-UNK-AN_GK0T-GK1C&amp;mibextid=2Rb1fB&amp;ref=watch_permalink&amp;v=2888410871303000">online</a>.</p>
