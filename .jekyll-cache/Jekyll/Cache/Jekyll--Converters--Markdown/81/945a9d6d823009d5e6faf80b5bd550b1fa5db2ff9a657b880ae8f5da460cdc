I"<p>I have been working with my co-authors from XX Networks, David Chaum, Mario Yaksetig and William Carter, to develop a special trick for wallets. The idea is that in a major, and catastrophic, event where several wallets are hacked, there is still a possibility that proof ownership of the wallet.</p>

<p>Events like that had already occurred therefore it seems highly desirable that wallets have such capability.</p>

<p>We are now working on the final version of the work and it will soon be made public!</p>
