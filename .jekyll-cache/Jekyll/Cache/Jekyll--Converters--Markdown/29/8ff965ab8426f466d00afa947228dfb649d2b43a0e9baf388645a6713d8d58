I"<p>We are happy to announce that <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1471">our work</a> which introduces a novel consensus  construction was accepted and will be presented at <a href="https://acns2025.fordaysec.de/accepted-papers/">ACNS’25</a>.</p>

<p>Here we introduced a new VRF with forward security capabilities. That is a significant improvement since VRF are used in proof of stake based blockchain protocols which could be target of ``nothing at stake’’ attacks, where old keys can be used to attack the protocol.</p>
