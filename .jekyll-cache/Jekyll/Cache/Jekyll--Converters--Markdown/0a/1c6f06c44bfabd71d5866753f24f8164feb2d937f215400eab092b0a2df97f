<p>We will have our new paper, named ‚ÄúDouble Auction Meets Blockchain: Consensus from Scored Bid-Assignment‚Äù, presented next week at ACNS‚Äô25 in Munich. So naturally we have picked this paper to release our second episode of our Alice &amp; Bob Podcast Episode #2.</p>

<p>The core idea of this work is to harvest the computational effort on matching buy and sell bids in an auction to build a consensus mechanism. That is a tricky task to pull off as it requires the redesign the consensus protocol and the structure of the blockchain data structure.  The security analysis can also be quite heavy, but we managed to pull it off, and it is going to be presented at <a href="/publication/2025-01-01-MELCOIN">ACNS‚Äô25 in Munich</a>. Xiangyu Su is traveling to Germany next week to tell everything about it to the interested audience!</p>

<p>If you are interested in getting a short, but insightful, glimpse on the contents of the paper while doing something else, please consider check our  episode #2 which is available <a href="https://youtu.be/P6NJmsHXNDg">here</a>.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
