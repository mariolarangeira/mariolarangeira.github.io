<p>Here is our new protocol named  <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/1643.pdf">AucRandMUSEN</a> which is also available in the <a href="https://iohk.io/jp/research/library/papers/optimizing-liveness-for-blockchain-based-sealed-bid-auctions-in-rational-settings/">IOG Library</a>, which was presented by Huang in the <a href="">CoDecFin Workshop</a>.</p>

<p>We proposed a novel cryptographic primitive with some very interesting properties, and we also outline where it can be used. Alice and Bob presented a fairly didactical <a href="https://youtu.be/25xK1iHP_uQ">discussion about MUSEN</a>.</p>

<p>This is a somewhat different work from previous ones in the podcast, because it focuses in a building block.</p>
