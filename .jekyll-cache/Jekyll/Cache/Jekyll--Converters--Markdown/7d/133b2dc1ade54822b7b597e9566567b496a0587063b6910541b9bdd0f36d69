I"|<p>We had two works on MARBLE 2022.</p>

<p>One is our follow up [work][/publication/2022-07-12-MARBLE-Sleeve] on [Sleeve][/portfolio/2021-06-21-ACNS/]. The other is Maxâ€™s approach to the [Hydra][https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/299]. Namely the [Interhead Protocol][https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1188].</p>

<p>Here, instead of having only a single head, i.e., group of users interacting off-chain via the Hydra protocol, alone, our protocol allows two heads to merge into a single head, hence the title. It is a very interesting work since it gives more agility to the groups of users.</p>

<p>Our work was presented at MARBLE 2022</p>
