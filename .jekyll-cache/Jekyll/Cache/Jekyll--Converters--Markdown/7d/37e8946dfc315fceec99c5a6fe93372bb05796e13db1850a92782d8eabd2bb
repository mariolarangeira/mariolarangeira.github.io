I"Ð<p>We are excited to announce that Su has its <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1060">work</a> accepted for <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/acns2024/accepted-papers-r2/">ACNSâ€™24</a>.</p>

<p>Su and Pengfei introduced a new protocol in order to trace contact between people. The main idea is that an application on, for example on the phone, would keep a list of other phones that approximated. Then one the owner of phone assigns that it got symptoms of an infectious disease (like, Covid, for example) it can release a ciphered list of contacts which the other phones could check and know if it was exposed or not.</p>

<p>and signature schemeintroduces  the distributed  proof-of-deep-learning (D-PoDL) which repurposes the computational power of networks to train computational models. In that sense, Suâ€™s work fits in the approach of finding better uses of huge computational power available in blockchain systems in particular those based in proof-of-work ones.</p>
