I"<p>We are excited to announce that Su has its <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1060">work</a> accepted for <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/acns2024/accepted-papers-r2/">ACNSâ€™24</a>.</p>

<p>Su introduces  the distributed  proof-of-deep-learning (D-PoDL) which repurposes the computational power of networks to train computational models. In that sense, Suâ€™s work fits in the approach of finding better uses of huge computational power available in blockchain systems in particular those based in proof-of-work ones.</p>
