I"O<p>Seminar about stake pool, more concretely on desirable properties of a stake pool.</p>

<p>Today was a short seminar about stake pools. I have been discussing and reading about what would be desirable in a stake pool in the point of view of the pool members. Essentially the seminar was myself  sharing with our group the list of requirements I formulated.</p>

<p>It was a nice discussion. In particular, I was quite happy because Max and Matthias gave valid suggestions and observations. In fact, I had to reformulate the list. Hopefully soon I will be able to disclose the draft.</p>
