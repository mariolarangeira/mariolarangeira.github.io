<p>While attending Eurocryptâ€™24  in Zurich, I had the chance to revisit the city and meet old friends/colleagues while meeting new ones. Needless to say that the presentations were super interesting. The whole event was quite fun!</p>

<p>In addition to the conference activities, the IOG team recorded short interviews where me and my colleagues had the chance to explain what we do and what we are passioned about in our work.</p>
