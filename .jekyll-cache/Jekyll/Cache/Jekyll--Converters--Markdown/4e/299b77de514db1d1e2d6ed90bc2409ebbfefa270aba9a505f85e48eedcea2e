I"C<p>During the week of November 14-20 the whole Research Division of <a href="https://iohk.io/en/research/">Input Output</a> met at the University of Edinburgh.</p>

<p>It was a very pleasing week. It was a chance to meet again colleagues which we usually only see during the remote weekly meetings. It was also a chance to know our lab in Edinburgh, and of course, the city.</p>

<p>In the end we got some <a href="https://twitter.com/mariolarangeira/status/1594249421373722625">nice pictures</a>, and now I know where the inspiration for the Harry Potter series came from.</p>
