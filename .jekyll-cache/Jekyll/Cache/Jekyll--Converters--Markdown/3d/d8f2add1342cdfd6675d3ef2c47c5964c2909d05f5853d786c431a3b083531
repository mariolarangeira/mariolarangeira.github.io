I"l<p>Hail Hydra!</p>

<p>As a follow up of last week seminar on Extended UTXO Model proposed by <a href="http://fc20.ifca.ai/wtsc/WTSC2020/WTSC20_paper_25.pdf">Chakravarty et al.</a>, today we took a look on the  <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/299">Hydra protocol</a>.</p>

<p>This is very convenient because Hidra is based on the Extended UTXO. We did a quick review on the state machine implemented by the protocol and the interplay between the extended UTXO and the state changes.</p>
