<p>We just had a presentation on the 19th International Conference on Applied Cryptography and Network Security. The original plan was to hold the event in the beautiful Kamakura, unfortunately the conference had to be virtual.</p>

<p>This paper was really nice to work with my co-authors, David Chaum, Mario Yaksetig and William Carter.</p>
