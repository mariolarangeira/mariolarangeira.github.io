I"§<p>We had two works on ICISC 2022.</p>

<p>One is our follow up <a href="/publication/2022-12-02-ICISC-WOTSwana">work</a> on <a href="/portfolio/2021-06-21-ACNS/">Sleeve</a>. The other is my first single author <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/299">paper</a>. Namely the <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/1188">Interhead Protocol</a>.</p>

<p>Here, instead of having only a single head, i.e., group of users interacting off-chain via the Hydra protocol, alone, our protocol allows two heads to merge into a single head, hence the title. It is a very interesting work since it gives more agility to the groups of users.</p>

<p>Our work was presented at MARBLE 2022</p>
