I"J<p>Project on privacy</p>

<p>Mizuuchi presented a survey on the existing notions of privacy. We noticed that this work actually embraces several meanings, for example, untraceability and unlinkability of transactions, but there are more. His seminar covered works as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Monero/Cryptonote</li>
  <li>ZCash</li>
  <li>Crypsinous (S&amp;P’19)/ Ganesh et al. (Euro’19)</li>
  <li>``Privacy-Enhancing Overlays in Bitcoin’’ (FC’15) by Meiklejhn and Orlandi</li>
</ul>

<p>Next week there is no seminar because there is Asiacrypt in Kobe starting from December 8.</p>
