I"«<p>With some delay, Iâ€™m sharing the publication of our Lightweight Virtual Channels. We denote it ``lightweightâ€™â€™, because differently from previous constructions of virtual channels, our protocol does not need smart contracts to be implemented. Hence, it can be freely used in Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Our presentation was on the <a href="https://cans2020.at/program-day-2/">second day</a>. One advantage of the new normal of virtual conferences is that the recorded presentations are widely available.</p>

<p>Max conducted the online presentation, and answered the questions from the audience.</p>
