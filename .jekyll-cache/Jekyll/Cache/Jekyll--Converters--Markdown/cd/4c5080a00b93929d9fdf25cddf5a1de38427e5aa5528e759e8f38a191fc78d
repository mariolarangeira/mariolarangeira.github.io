<p>This time we will cover one of our newest paper, named “Adaptively Secure Blockchain-Aided Decentralized Storage Networks: Formalization and Generic Construction”. It is still unpublished, but available in the <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/887">Eprint Archive</a> and it is to topic of conversation between our characters in their podcast: Alice &amp; Bob Podcast Episode #3.</p>

<p>However there is a catch!</p>

<p>This time we have two videos about the paper. A <a href="https://youtu.be/adgpOgGII0c">short version</a> (5 minutes), which is enough to glimpse the idea of the draft. But for those with more time and interest we also have a  <a href="https://youtu.be/42-m9OBCN0w">long version</a> (about 60 minutes).</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
