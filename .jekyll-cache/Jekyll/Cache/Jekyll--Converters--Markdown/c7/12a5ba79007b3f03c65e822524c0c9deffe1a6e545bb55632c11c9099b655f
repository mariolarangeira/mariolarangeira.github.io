<p>During a week in July I attended <a href="https://africacrypt2023.tn/">Africacrypt 2023</a> in Tunisia. I have presented the <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/183">Maraved√≠ Protocol</a> which is a joint work with Maxim Jourenko and shows a novel way to think finality.</p>

<p>I was very excited for the event because it was my first time in Africa, and, needless to say, it was very hot. Luckily the hotel was great, with a beach next to it. Which I may say I enjoyed every morning before the conference, given the benefits of the jetlag (I was waking up 5AM).</p>

<p>The presentation went without problems. I prepared a set of slides without getting into much detail in particular in the change of states of the channel. I focused on the motivation and outline of the whole protocol.</p>

<p>By a coincidence, the excursion of the conference was in the El Jem which I was already considering to visit. So I did not need to do any preparation, just joined the conference trip. El Jem is the largest coliseum outside of Rome.</p>

<p>The dinner was in the town of Sousse so I had the chance to walk around and see the city. It was really nice and enjoyable.</p>
