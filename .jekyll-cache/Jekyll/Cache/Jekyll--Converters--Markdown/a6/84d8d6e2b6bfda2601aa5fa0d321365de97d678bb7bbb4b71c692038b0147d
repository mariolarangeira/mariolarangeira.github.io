I"0<p>We are excited to announce that Su has its <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1059">work</a> accepted for <a href="https://nss-socialsec2023.cyber.kent.ac.uk/">NSS’23</a>.</p>

<p>Su introduces  a distributed  proof-of-deep-learning (D-PoDL)</p>

<p>Max came up with a better construction for the <a href="/publication/2022-07-14-MARBLE-Interhead">Interhead Protocol (which was presented at MARBLE 2022)</a>. Briefly, this protocol implements a technique to merge “heads” of the <a href="https://www.springerprofessional.de/en/fast-isomorphic-state-channels/19786778">Hydra Protocol</a>. This paves a way to build better decentralized applications. The capability of merge layer-2 groups of participants provides more flexibility.</p>

<p>We remark that used interactively, a second head, with only two participants, one which is also participant of an earlier bigger head, could sponsor the merge of both heads. The result is a protocol of enlarging off-chain isomorphic group.</p>

<p>Soon the manuscript will be available in the FC and EPrint website!</p>
