<p>We will have our new paper, named “Double Auction Meets Blockchain: Consensus from Scored Bid-Assignment”, will be presented next week at ACNS’25 in Munich. So naturally we have picked this paper to release our second episode of our Alice &amp; Bob Podcast Episode #2.</p>

<p>The core idea of this work is to harvest the computational effort on matching buy and sell bids in an auction to build a consensus. That is a trick task as it requires the redesign the consensus protocol and the structure of the blockchain data structure.  The security analysis can also be quite heavy, but we managed to pull it off, and it is going to be presented at <a href="/publication/2025-01-01-MELCOIN">ACNS’25 in Munich</a>. Xiangyu Su is traveling to Germany next week to tell everything about it to the interested audience!</p>

<p>If you are interested in getting a short glimpse on the contents of the paper while doing something else, please consider check our  episode #2 which is available <a href="https://youtu.be/P6NJmsHXNDg">here</a>.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
