<p>Me and Eunice joined a talk show organized by Antonio from the Kyodai Remittance, with the head of the  Consulate General of Brazil in Tokyo Guilherme Patriota, Tiago BonTempo, Ta√≠s Ueta, Rodrigo Fernandes and Rafaela Yoshiy about studying and building a career in Japan.</p>

<p>The conversation started with Rodrigo from <a href="https://www.studyinjapan.go.jp/ja/">Study in Japan</a> providing a thorough overview of available scholarships and preparation tips to move to Japan for studying. As I former scholarship awarded student myself, I familiar with some of the options presented there, however there is more available.</p>

<p>Me and Eunice shared some experiences with respect to our career here in Japan. It perhaps maybe a bit biased since both of us have academic careers. However, we also commented a bit of positions on industry, as much as we could.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, for the English/Japanese speaking audience, the event was carried in Portuguese without subtitles. For those interested, the whole show is available <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?extid=CL-UNK-UNK-UNK-AN_GK0T-GK1C&amp;mibextid=2Rb1fB&amp;ref=watch_permalink&amp;v=2888410871303000">online</a>.</p>
