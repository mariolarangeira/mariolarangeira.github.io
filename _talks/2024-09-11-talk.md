We had a big joint event at Oookayama Campus organized by IOG and Tokyo Tech, soon to become Science Tokyo! Charles Hoskinson, the CEO of IOG, visited us to outline what have for the future in terms of research. I took the opportunity to review the role of our research group at Tokyo in the development of Cardano blockchain.

Few papers we worked are considered critical technology in production in the Cardano system, including the consensus protocol, Ouroboros, and the delegation framework, which allowed the dawn a huge stake pool industry world wide.  

Here is backstage picture by Tim Harrison, IOG VP of Community and Ecosystem, who was kind enough to shot a picture of me while waiting to go on stage.
