During a week in July I attended [Africacrypt 2023](https://africacrypt2023.tn/) in Tunisia. I have presented the [Maravedí Protocol](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/183) which is a joint work with Maxim Jourenko and shows a novel way to think finality.

I was very excited for the event because it was my first time in Africa, and, needless to say, it was very hot. Luckily the hotel was great, with a beach next to it. Which I may say I enjoyed every morning before the conference, given the benefits of the jetlag (I was waking up at 5AM).

The presentation went without problems. I prepared a set of slides without getting into much detail in particular in the change of states of the channel. I focused on the motivation and outline of the whole protocol. Despite of that, I got questions regarding the name "maravedí", which has relations with Morocco history as I heard from other researcher, and the main technical difficulty of the protocol which is basically to ``synchronize'' the channel transaction and the ledger payment.

 By a coincidence, the excursion of the conference was in the El Jem which I was already considering to visit. So I did not need to do any preparation, just joined the conference trip. El Jem is the largest coliseum outside of Rome.

   The dinner was in the town of Sousse so I had the chance to walk around and see the city. It was really nice and enjoyable.
