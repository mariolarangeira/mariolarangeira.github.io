  This week the International Conference on Network and System Security (NSS'23) happens and we have our work on distributed deep learning in the [program](https://nss-socialsec2023.cyber.kent.ac.uk/program.php). It is a joint work of me, Xiangyu Su and Keisuke Tanaka. Su is the main author and has introduced the main idea.
  
  Su noticed that it is possible to harvest of a  computational power from, say, of a proof of work protocol, in order to train models for machine learning. In order to do that we had to introduce new notions like "distributed proof-of-deep-learning". 
  
  Basically, instead of "correct hash value" as in proof-of-work, the system trains models up until a certain suitable accuracy level in the learning curve. The paper is already available [here](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-39828-5_7) and [here](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1059). Please take a look. 

 Me and Su verified the presentation slides last Thursday at the Covfefe and everything is set. My friend and neighbor Prof. Tomohiro Hayashi took a nice picture of us and sent me. 
 
 
 Unfortunately, I could not travel to UK to attend the conference this time, but Su is already there. I am looking forward for the report of the presentation from Su.

Here is the picture!
