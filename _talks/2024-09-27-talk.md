When I moved to Sao Jos√© dos Campos to prepare to attend university (ITA) in Brazil, I heard from teachers that in some university somewhere they took seeds from Newton's famous apple tree and planted a new tree in the campus. 

We were not quite sure whether that story was true or not. Nor we got the name of the university. Nonetheless me and classmates would wonder how cool/inspiring it would be to look through the window in your classroom and see that tree over there. 

Fast forward, 25 years later, I met the tree!

Thanks, Cambridge! 
See you in the next adventure!
