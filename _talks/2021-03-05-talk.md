Payment Trees!

Our presentation was on the [third day](https://fc21.ifca.ai/program.php) of the conference, and here is our pre-recorded [presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_s01QsnLiY). 

This work presents a method to more efficiently close channels. Its performance is similar to protocols based on Smart Contracts, like Sprites. It also presentes a vulnerability on other protocols, as we have discussed in our [internal seminars](/teaching/2020-09-10-atomic-multi-channels).
