During the week of November 14-20 the whole Research Division of [Input Output](https://iohk.io/en/research/) met at the University of Edinburgh.

It was a very pleasing week. It was a chance to meet again colleagues which we usually see only during the remote weekly meetings. It was also a chance to know our lab in Edinburgh, and of course, the city.

In the end we got some [nice pictures](https://twitter.com/mariolarangeira/status/1594249421373722625), and now I know where the inspiration for the Harry Potter series came from.
