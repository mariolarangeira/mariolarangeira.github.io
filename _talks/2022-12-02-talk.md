December, 2nd 2022 the Second Meeting of the Brazilian Diaspora in Science and Innovation happened at the Brazilian Embassy in Tokyo. I had the chance to join a panel to discuss the current situation of researchers in Japan.

 The topics of our panel covered how to improve the Brazilian image as a research powerhouse to the eyes of the Japanese public, what are the challenges we, as researchers, face here in Japan, how we can improve the interplay between the research teams in Japan and Brazil, and several other topics.

 The event also hosted the creation ceremony of the Brazilian students association in Japan, which hopefully will provide a lot of support and congregate new scholarship receivers in the future. Helping to nurture a welcoming environment for Brazilian young researches.
